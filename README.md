This java program solves a linear equations system of the form:

Ax = B

Using the Cramer method.  For example:

|  3  4 1|    |-1|
| -1  2 0|  = | 2|
|  1 -3 8|    | 0|

Feel free to use and modify this code.  In the class CramerTest you can
see how to use this solver through the Cramer class.

I will add some exceptions soon to make this class a little bit more
robust.

Enjoy!
