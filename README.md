This java program solves a linear equations system of the form:

Ax = B

Using the Cramer method.

Feel free to use and modify this code.  In the class CramerTest you can
see how to use this solver through the Cramer class.

I will add some exceptions soon to make this class a little bit more
robust.

Enjoy!
